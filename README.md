Dronestream-Map
===============

Heatmap of Dronestream data.

Used the Google Maps API as well as Dronestre.am API for Drone strike data to make a representation of american drone strikes over the years.

Currently utilizing JQuery and Javascript to get, parse and present all the data. 

The circles are not the blast radius but rather a representation of how many casualties were caused by the attacks. 

Will look into adding a filter functionality. (Drone strikes by decade, by amount of deaths, etc.)
